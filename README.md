## Description

Calendar Log is a website that allows you to keep track of your day and set a daily to-do list. 

- It allows a user to input items to-do by the hour 
- It allows a user to save them to local storage so they remain even after a session ends
- It allows the user to clear all events to start with a clean slate on a new day
- Each hour is color coded; gray means the time has passed, red is the current hour, and green means upcoming/the time has not passed
